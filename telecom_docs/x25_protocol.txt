X.25 Protocol Documentation
--------------------------

1. Timer Specifications

1.1 T1 Timer
- Primary response timer, set to 3 seconds by default
- Used when a device sends a frame and expects a response
- Vendor-specific implementations:
  * AT&T: 1.5 seconds for domestic networks
  * NTT Japan: 5 seconds for international links
  * European PTTs: 2-4 seconds depending on network load

1.2 T2 Timer
- Acknowledgment delay timer
- Typically set to 0.2 seconds
- Prevents unnecessary retransmissions
- Used in conjunction with T1 for optimal flow control

1.3 T3 Timer
- Idle channel timer
- Detects link inactivity
- Default value: 180 seconds
- Can be adjusted based on network conditions

2. Frame Types and Handling

2.1 Information Frames (I-frames)
- Carry user data
- Numbered sequentially
- Subject to flow control
- Maximum size determined by network

2.2 Supervisory Frames (S-frames)
- Control flow of I-frames
- Types: RR (Receive Ready), RNR (Receive Not Ready), REJ (Reject)
- Essential for reliable data transfer

2.3 Unnumbered Frames (U-frames)
- Used for link management
- Set up and tear down connections
- Not subject to normal flow control

3. Error Recovery Procedures

3.1 Basic Error Recovery
- Uses Go-Back-N ARQ
- Retransmission triggered by T1 timeout
- REJ frame can request immediate retransmission

3.2 Extended Error Recovery
- Optional feature in some implementations
- Selective retransmission capability
- More efficient for high-latency links
