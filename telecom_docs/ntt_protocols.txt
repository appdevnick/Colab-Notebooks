1. X.25 Implementation

1.1 Timer Configuration
- T1: 5 seconds (optimized for international links)
- T2: 0.25 seconds
- T3: 240 seconds
- T4: 90 seconds (link reset)

1.2 International Considerations
- Extended timers for satellite links
- Enhanced error recovery for high-latency paths
- Support for multiple character sets
- International gateway interfaces

2. Network Architecture

2.1 Domestic Network
- High-speed backbone
- Distributed switching centers
- Metropolitan area networks
- Rural access points

2.2 International Links
- Satellite connections
- Undersea cable systems
- Border gateway exchanges
- Protocol conversion services

3. Service Features

3.1 Reliability Measures
- Redundant routing
- Automatic failover
- Load balancing
- Quality monitoring

3.2 Performance Optimization
- Adaptive timer adjustments
- Dynamic routing
- Traffic prioritization
- Congestion management

4. Implementation Guidelines

4.1 Timer Selection
- Base T1 value: 5 seconds
- Adjustable based on:
  * Link type (satellite/cable)
  * Distance
  * Network load
  * Quality requirements

4.2 Error Handling
- Extended error recovery
- Selective retransmission
- Priority-based queuing
- Flow control optimization
